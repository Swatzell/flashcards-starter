# FlashCards Game

## Abstract:

I developed a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! A user can see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

## Learning Goals:
Contribute code to an partially constructed application,
Follow spec/prompts to make a working application,
Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and 
Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Wins + Challenges:

A big take away for this project for me was always read through every file before starting anything. I immediately started tackling testing and then when it came to implementation of the actual code to make the project work I realized it wanted me to make a seperate JS file for rounds and it also wanted certain functions done certain ways so lesson learned to always read through everything before starting. A big win was initially getting every test to pass. Once I realized I had to start moving functions around and modifying toward the end I might have made some no longer pass but I was running out of time. Either way overall this was a really great learning experience and a great first time working with TDD.
